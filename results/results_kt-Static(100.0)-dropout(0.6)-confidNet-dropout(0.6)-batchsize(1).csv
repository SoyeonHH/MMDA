UweZVaFqruU[2],credit a lot of people ask what kind of credit do i need in order to buy a home well there's no set answer but there's a couple of things we look for we,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.4495103,0.29762565655576556,0.5312488223849331,0.5033833509287284,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
UweZVaFqruU[3],for we kind of look for as kind of a minimum score that we're trying to have in order to get an approval and obviously the higher the score the easier your approval will be the score,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4507374,0.11978236908166484,0.5316697965819138,0.4452158680180213,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

UweZVaFqruU[6],another general tip is we're looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of months so if you don't have any credit you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage which is the biggest piece of credit you'll ever get,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.45105636,0.34605955375186737,0.5309763158446146,0.48655623278004656,[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.]

WoL4fCxGd8Q[4],singing has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that michael jackson did with paul mccartney,[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.44433305,0.5729767809643722,0.5891989968871202,0.18172226292123358,[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
WoL4fCxGd8Q[5],both artists are amazing talents but together they didn't really have amazing song writing capabilities when they were working in the same space and this song sort of feels like this too in fact,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.447545,0.313167798708732,0.5318553060265988,0.4922963959715678,[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

X2Hs89fZ2-c[1],we start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the software now,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45041588,0.37104267801483626,0.5323977167785297,0.5039784510377556,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[2],and pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.44977143,0.28056417628516717,0.5318700675470905,0.43149108010517173,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[3],the last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to and in general,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45171183,0.26101906306712064,0.5328903623379869,0.5176086142466658,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[4],software make sure you understand the difference between layers and features and and feature classes classes and feature classes and feature we also,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4522966,0.2691410055625586,0.5323225967683494,0.46643295120378847,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[5],allows us to display these not features for example population of the state population change what else can we display disease rates all of these,[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45097616,0.22937323899901407,0.5317026251731862,0.4940055593434214,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[6],software now in module you were exposed to and so,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45000857,0.16229612605507582,0.5312378120609657,0.5387212031398108,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[7],disease rates all of these things can be stored within the data as an attribute table can be displayed this is,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4489316,0.3305440783495396,0.5311104308305425,0.49904023456864877,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[8],displayed this is what makes software so powerful it is also in this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are so,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4494958,0.2818801014015757,0.5319087140704111,0.4710906465639633,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[9],data are so making sure we know where to find what types of makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was so we,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.44729042,0.5120732315335397,0.5323025835727234,0.49713413008109086,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[10],five and in this class we really only use or feature classes so make,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4511954,0.3735114112193173,0.5324607123491536,0.4948503221621281,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[11],classes so make sure that you understand what separates and feature classes feature classes are stored in are not make sure you understand,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45478103,0.23827689824174247,0.5320963209143517,0.48506469769886607,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[12],and so you should remember that is the main component of this is where,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45103425,0.39005167201681534,0.5323681814720533,0.429285836589845,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

X2Hs89fZ2-c[14],up in you will see you have several files associated with each data set so,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4547699,0.18023976107920714,0.5319210613330854,0.5122003274205972,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[15],set so pay attention to the files that are associated with it and how to move data from place to place regardless of the data format we're looking at,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45071018,0.48084961953456695,0.5317692758606415,0.4267817637618754,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[16],of this is where you create your data edit data view data analyze your map create maps it is the workhorse of the program,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.45290053,0.39691570578927426,0.5317281701060301,0.4764337585548154,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[17],the second component is is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different change projection added everything like that,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.44826788,0.38670552166237226,0.5314944695404376,0.4260868895982917,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
X2Hs89fZ2-c[18],and then the last part the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course where we get,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.44946176,0.29158759701545245,0.6260286920538517,0.44689087115806136,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

gLTxaEcx41E[1],i can just bet that the citizens of athens as they thought about sophocles towards the end of the century would have thought about how the old man and his very very long career which is full of sufferings as well as successes could be identified with oedipus as a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4515558,0.3614561533999239,0.6376443589721312,0.43696810753016874,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

gLTxaEcx41E[5],and what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages well what i want to emphasize about text j which is part of the text i it is this privileged position of as not only the founding hero of athens as understood by the democracy in the century a version of the city of athens but also his role as the initiator of all athenians into what is called the mysteries,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4492886,0.19280088270024676,0.7793540194275184,0.46185459857482725,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

gLTxaEcx41E[8],and that's why i want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of athens which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.44949788,0.277143385371471,0.5319249413172833,0.47954903129201565,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
gLTxaEcx41E[9],what is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero and how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in that's what this is all about and that's what certainly sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1.],0.44688877,0.36456831922830424,0.6238670522801295,0.6578581491382594,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]
