102213[2],there's definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really jokes and there's a lot of moments like that the story sucks,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4128524,6.977343,0.322877,0.36301035
102213[3],moments like that the story sucks the characters were really wooden and plain and i liked some of the actors and actresses so i'm not sure what was going on there it,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.4096899,9.07098,0.3500377,-0.3156615
102213[4],there it just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and uhh i guess the box office is reflecting that unfortunately,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40869063,4.8388286,0.37737638,-0.5808677
102213[5],reflecting that unfortunately it seems like it'll be a good bomb,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.409585,7.552951,0.32879913,0.33975226

102213[8],million then i was thinking i don't know how a comedy can really be two hundred fifty million but you know i guess with all this hype it's worth seeing,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39621317,6.539882,0.36062902,0.3483315

102213[11],animals there seems to be a ton of but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and i'm not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know it all because the animals really weren't that impressive,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.],0.39495593,7.265638,0.36231464,0.34778118

135623[0],hey guys my name is emma and i'm here to talk to you about a movie i saw recently spider man three umm,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.3826521,8.4119625,0.31080955,0.31209713
135623[1],i gotta say i've seen the other two spider man movies and i wasn't really that impressed you know they're pretty entertaining,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.38500917,6.6678224,0.3358968,0.15638316
135623[2],impressed you know they're pretty entertaining i guess and i'm a fan of uhh kirsten dunst so i always like to watch movies that she's in but i didn't have high expectations for spider man three because i didn't really like the first two but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations you,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39437014,7.7395864,0.30552173,0.3335346
135623[3],expectations you know it was probably worse than i thought it would be actually,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39662445,9.151831,0.34623158,0.33040583
135623[4],granted i only paid two dollars to see it uhh there's a really cheap movie theater where i live that i can go see movies that have come out umm recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie you know just really cheesy uhh the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying like the stuff i don't,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.3961028,9.038216,0.34012663,0.34327704
135623[5],the stuff i don't know i'm not really into that and the action in it was really not that exciting umm the,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39385587,8.901666,0.31546783,0.27359033
135623[6],exciting umm the acting also horrible you know i realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in you know kind of over the top kind of cheesy but i don't know i feel,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39320982,6.1951337,0.3491521,-0.10334326
135623[7],i don't know i feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the spider man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment i think that they could,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.38831222,8.995159,0.32280952,0.32373077
135623[8],disappointment i think that they could have done a much better job on that movie,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41105592,8.945299,0.3628158,-0.3756218
135623[9],umm so in a scale from like one to five i think i'd give it like a two honestly just not,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39110428,9.368706,0.3059193,0.33680588
136196[0],hi this is my review of jurassic park three,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.3975677,8.693465,0.30572927,0.3185646
136196[1],uhh this is the third jurassic park obviously in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by steven spielberg he does executive,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.37551445,7.246963,0.3330968,0.27824795
136196[2],forced i don't think it was needed at all and i didn't really enjoy it i actually found,[0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.38922095,7.4020095,0.30392697,0.32183743

136196[8],what i found most exciting about this movie when i first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars sam neill who was absent in the second movie,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40930742,6.2388935,0.3417967,0.3487376

136196[10],uhh the second movie i didn't think was nearly as good as the first which is one of my all time favorite movies but uhh the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39507258,8.884922,0.30358845,0.34095865

136196[14],uhh the story's just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced i don't think it was,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40968263,10.3562565,0.33972132,-0.74195516

200941[2],stutter i guess i didn't like the plot so once the plot got ruined i really didn't care,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39739025,6.8223963,0.34165752,0.32669348
200941[3],the movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long it,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41670924,11.225421,0.35266232,-0.2548989
200941[4],that long it was definitely a comedy and i guess if you're a true simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39514065,5.322719,0.302955,0.31090343
200941[5],but you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks so,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3907625,7.802827,0.33644414,-0.05960557
200941[6],six bucks so if you're thinking about seeing it i wouldn't recommend it,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41119468,5.609776,0.34262365,0.34390783
200941[7],maybe rent it that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it i wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show and the shows are free so,[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4001919,6.6434007,0.3148291,0.33670974
200941[8],think you should it's been out in theaters quite awhile i'm pretty sure,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40721625,10.279766,0.2779081,0.34016186
200941[9],quite awhile i'm pretty sure they'll be taking it out soon and in my opinion this is pretty much just a big let down,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.37081605,7.9098907,0.30150133,0.31735194
200941[10],there stutter wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were i had already seen cause they were in the commercials,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.3917961,6.895001,0.30946815,0.32830024
200941[11],so if you own a tv and you saw the commercials i wouldn't recommend seeing the movie and even if you didn't see the commercials i wouldn't really recommend the movie,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.38031566,5.3846955,0.32282573,0.26171005

221274[4],the premise isn't anything too far fetched out of a wacky simpsons episode and the postmodern uhh references within it to uhh movies like titanic and umm other references or nothing more than something you might expect from a halloween special to the shining or something like that so,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40782964,7.847981,0.34753686,0.35436344

24196[7],but as i said before if you if you stutter haven't been feeling the other rocky movies as of late i wouldn't waste my time seeing this,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4074769,7.4327145,0.30211377,0.34992832

24196[10],umm it's it's stutter gotten great reviews around but to tell you the truth i thought they should have stopped at rocky one,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40035647,7.4917703,0.31168425,0.3305719

267466[2],umm in typical foreign film fashion it was all about character development and all about the background story and getting to know people and,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4019665,9.056244,0.3243826,0.30988353

267466[4],that but when it's in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of actually,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.38431674,7.989988,0.3513825,-0.6231649
267466[5],umm the basic plot of the story is that this guy franco is a film maker and he's worried about uhh getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy so he's,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4014712,7.940592,0.3359955,0.33831882
267466[6],crazy so he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and franco's forced to flee his country he has to leave,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4057923,6.8037124,0.32183248,0.32092035
267466[7],his country he has to leave umm because he's kind of been indicted for some things he's not looking,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.4083172,8.873782,0.30782318,0.33271426
267466[8],some things he's not looking very good he's not gonna be,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.4150725,9.008953,0.29488462,0.32329267
267466[9],looking very good he's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland umm,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40765232,9.091829,0.31076974,0.3260408
267466[10],umm so he leaves and in his new city he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says well can you film my daughter's wedding and franco says sure i'll do that and,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39660436,7.6588073,0.32487696,0.33564144
267466[11],that and basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married so it's,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.39878017,7.39324,0.3066947,0.28699926
267466[12],umm this is a foreign film umm,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4073906,5.584141,0.32191253,0.20485215
267466[13],married so it's kind of it's all out there it's a little bit ridiculous,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.39848155,10.159997,0.30964118,0.33335686
267466[14],it's all out there it's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl and it,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39991874,10.281802,0.36678553,-0.3393395
267466[15],girl and it kind of doesn't really fit together umm,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40153176,6.891108,0.33554,-0.4554438
267466[16],umm i think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long drawn out and ridiculous film,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3967167,7.336641,0.3429289,0.3325835
267466[17],i think it would be enough to swallow umm the whole scandal thing and i can't,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39619273,8.371895,0.3039109,0.3233717
267466[18],scandal thing and i can't i can't stutter even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in depth and,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40226102,8.056183,0.3597489,0.19815041
267466[19],depth and so umm convoluted and messy you just kind,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3949712,6.8438497,0.32326025,0.17664704
267466[20],messy you just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself umm in order to figure it all out and,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39928204,6.3273554,0.31233543,0.28303838
267466[21],all out and even for myself i still wonder if i got the whole thing right it's that,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.3872245,6.539273,0.3014272,0.32638198
267466[22],whole thing right it's that messy umm,[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40030205,7.4235177,0.30111897,0.33617532
267466[23],umm it's set in france and it's definitely subtitled so if you're not,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39161944,6.748092,0.30025697,0.33458632
267466[24],umm and that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge that happened because of it it it,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39339077,8.02219,0.3313099,0.32378507
267466[25],because of it it it stutter could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation umm,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3952189,8.92133,0.2992431,0.29711938
267466[26],umm when you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one it's just to much to digest it would,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.41043258,7.7989116,0.33425796,0.33948016
267466[27],digest it would have took me another two or three uhh just to to stutter figure this out and i don't think,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40670878,5.5295324,0.3252328,0.34728622
267466[28],figure this out and i don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated foreign or not i mean,[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39454925,8.955022,0.31480825,0.21103552
267466[29],foreign or not i mean entertainment value here is what i want and that's not what i was given in this film at all,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.37847894,8.70586,0.3408609,0.31173152
267466[30],i'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating umm,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40358442,6.644924,0.36072302,-0.74994624
267466[31],umm i can't think of anything uhh for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating umm,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41255146,7.522161,0.3443777,0.18656687
267466[32],umm if they would've broken it up i mean then it's just different films so you can't even it's comparing apples to oranges kind of umm,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3914982,8.607948,0.34743363,-0.122922614
267466[33],umm but that would've been a better alternative to what they did here umm,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41560674,8.227806,0.32784814,0.35550612
267466[34],subtitled so if you're not a fan of sub titles you're gonna want to steer clear of this one,[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.39017254,5.751955,0.29586306,0.3361343

273250[0],hello my name is mike and today i'll be talking to you about the movie traitor which i went and saw last night,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.4124434,7.6593776,0.32029575,0.30449885
273250[1],as formality here is my movie ticket,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39221293,8.1758795,0.3109585,-0.026609048
273250[2],premise it's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.3975696,4.976002,0.33357614,0.33537847
273250[3],there's the investigation element but that's it you know,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4072457,7.332757,0.31609118,0.351322
273250[4],it you know what's the story what's the point,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.38750476,8.909132,0.30158454,0.32661676
273250[5],there is none,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.42167938,8.3519745,0.33944947,0.08941136
273250[6],that's the flaw of this movie,[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.4096946,8.864444,0.31810695,0.33955133
273250[7],the script was written as sort of a sub element,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39972132,6.477012,0.3010016,0.31633782
273250[8],you know it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39533126,5.921474,0.31485307,0.33522713
273250[9],and that's why i can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five cause it was atrocious,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40535122,9.285363,0.36145943,-0.56286013
273250[10],and this isn't worth seeing at all cause i mean come on you can come up with better spy movies than this there are so,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40055466,9.096949,0.34695578,-0.7524736
273250[11],this there are so many,[1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.39600658,6.9057593,0.30450308,0.31388664
273250[12],and there it went,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.42189926,8.006313,0.32575178,0.35976762
273250[13],and i mean not necessarily like spy like james bond but counter like you know investigation spy movies there are so,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3982876,7.4066873,0.3019783,0.33392566

273250[15],so i have to say one out of five this was,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.38696468,7.426204,0.31509018,-0.22971334

5vwXp27bCLw[0],does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 1.],0.39866817,9.0296135,0.2980126,0.31771725
5vwXp27bCLw[1],if so is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system to try to get those banks to start lending i think it's,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.38169938,10.030256,0.28620535,0.30844474
5vwXp27bCLw[2],lending i think it's going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund,[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.414173,7.573657,0.29658037,0.29297388

5vwXp27bCLw[4],he specifically said again and again and again that his policies are going to be aimed to make sure that speculators don't benefit nor our people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 1.],0.3941536,10.20792,0.2956109,0.31023377

5vwXp27bCLw[8],but it will be interesting to watch what exactly will the new bailout for the banks look like what exactly is this new lending fund mean how,[0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40769583,8.723277,0.28860122,0.32171166

5vwXp27bCLw[12],the second issue that brings up and i think one that needs to be looked at very very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs it's,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.3931796,10.844565,0.28569221,0.32851613

P0UHzR4CmYg[2],for instance when you're doing e mail triage every morning do you question whether a particular e mail is from a real person or is it an e mail blast that's been personalized to you are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re targeted or do you stop looking at your direct messages on because all you seem to receive are automated messages your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are and in this discussion of automation let's also consider the human error factor,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.],0.39114863,6.3359294,0.3122291,0.32080567

UweZVaFqruU[0],hi this is tom floyd vice president of real estate at member one federal credit union bringing you another member one money minute,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40321946,7.4991193,0.300923,0.32188267
UweZVaFqruU[1],today i want to talk to you a little bit about credit a lot,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40887952,7.5209503,0.29767197,0.33509713
UweZVaFqruU[2],credit a lot of people ask what kind of credit do i need in order to buy a home well there's no set answer but there's a couple of things we look for we,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.4127974,7.441257,0.32344055,0.35108328
UweZVaFqruU[3],for we kind of look for as kind of a minimum score that we're trying to have in order to get an approval and obviously the higher the score the easier your approval will be the score,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.41319805,10.305156,0.30451477,0.31593895
UweZVaFqruU[4],be the score is a reflection of how well you pay your bills what type of credit you use how many inquiries you have what are the balances of your credit cards to your maximum limit,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.4037143,10.7127075,0.311289,0.27445766

UweZVaFqruU[6],another general tip is we're looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of months so if you don't have any credit you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage which is the biggest piece of credit you'll ever get,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.4024561,8.472742,0.28605527,0.31970322

WoL4fCxGd8Q[0],hey everybody what's up i wanted to do a review of the new west paul mccartney and collaboration four five seconds it,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.40812087,6.293872,0.28967154,0.31514943
WoL4fCxGd8Q[1],seconds it got released about a day or so ago and the is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song now,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.39266694,8.137884,0.28591508,0.32465428
WoL4fCxGd8Q[2],down it is there's no drums in the song this song unlike only one doesn't sound like there are any keyboards there's no drums and no auto tune and it's basically paul mccartney playing acoustic guitar and and share vocal duties going back and forth and,[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.41417456,8.388876,0.33756936,0.3455521
WoL4fCxGd8Q[3],forth and vocals are definitely pretty on this song and has some pretty singing has,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.39339197,8.369774,0.29041916,0.32543802
WoL4fCxGd8Q[4],singing has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that michael jackson did with paul mccartney,[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.39774293,5.9754853,0.33214992,0.33715755
WoL4fCxGd8Q[5],both artists are amazing talents but together they didn't really have amazing song writing capabilities when they were working in the same space and this song sort of feels like this too in fact,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.4054628,6.014176,0.2901827,0.33162224
WoL4fCxGd8Q[6],too in fact this song sounds like something i would hear if i went to some coffee shop that only served free trade coffee and ran into three strangers that were just jamming together and came up with this song,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],0.39159715,7.837497,0.30940306,0.32388675
WoL4fCxGd8Q[7],if west and paul name and name wasn't attached to this song and the song just got released by three unknown people and sounded the same it wouldn't be getting the attention it's getting at,[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40923077,9.285558,0.33400762,0.3418594
WoL4fCxGd8Q[8],song i give this song a i'd like to know what you guys think leave your comments in the section below thanks for,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40393353,6.966829,0.2899593,0.23912959

WoL4fCxGd8Q[10],information it's called if you have a question about anything you just it and you can find so much information at your finger tips but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song i've always found,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],0.39678037,6.779742,0.30305707,0.30487376
WoL4fCxGd8Q[11],examples i wasn't a fan of only one i thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song i didn't have much expectation going in i am a fan,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40075397,8.791511,0.3121472,0.3416837

WuaoxGAKue0[0],so because it doesn't make any sense i'm not going to remember any of it,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41653448,9.149678,0.35402024,0.33867347
X2Hs89fZ2-c[0],in this module we're are focusing specifically on spatial data,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.40658313,10.444975,0.31194514,0.2694658
X2Hs89fZ2-c[1],we start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the software now,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39610118,9.569631,0.29689878,0.33537334
X2Hs89fZ2-c[2],and pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39183295,9.06798,0.2992711,0.3301893
X2Hs89fZ2-c[3],the last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to and in general,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.4175886,8.400248,0.29981542,0.35273886
X2Hs89fZ2-c[4],software make sure you understand the difference between layers and features and and feature classes classes and feature classes and feature we also,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39920962,7.227251,0.2980161,0.29944837
X2Hs89fZ2-c[5],allows us to display these not features for example population of the state population change what else can we display disease rates all of these,[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40605414,7.3798966,0.30800164,0.32121003
X2Hs89fZ2-c[6],software now in module you were exposed to and so,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3954211,9.020197,0.310835,0.33369607
X2Hs89fZ2-c[7],disease rates all of these things can be stored within the data as an attribute table can be displayed this is,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39870858,9.680102,0.30506182,0.32724625
X2Hs89fZ2-c[8],displayed this is what makes software so powerful it is also in this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are so,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3896979,8.014856,0.2936772,0.3340329
X2Hs89fZ2-c[9],data are so making sure we know where to find what types of makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was so we,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39758235,7.546739,0.29106793,0.34229386
X2Hs89fZ2-c[10],five and in this class we really only use or feature classes so make,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3966648,7.7670436,0.30369353,0.33260918

X2Hs89fZ2-c[12],and so you should remember that is the main component of this is where,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.40296918,6.6785135,0.30839217,0.35090125

fz-MzQcOBwQ[11],summarize something i give you guys one or two little tit bits to take away but i've been racking my brain trying to figure out what i was going to take out of this book to share with you and it's impossible there is,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.4105791,6.527218,0.3312497,0.347502
fz-MzQcOBwQ[12],impossible there is so much good information that i really couldn't pick one thing,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40554148,8.914598,0.3130381,0.34235752

gKojBrXHhUc[0],them so i usually work as an anchor in the evenings reading those stories reporters have put together but i also,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.42167133,7.765446,0.30578846,0.34261233
gKojBrXHhUc[1],news room it's a lot of work a lot of deadlines and a lot of stress and you have to be willing to talk with people and not be afraid to go after interviews,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.38418978,6.784525,0.28315437,0.30477533
gL8h7lOPv1Q[0],out it's in and then you'll notice that there's just this little brief period of time there are,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.41396552,5.4745073,0.31683075,0.3543262
gL8h7lOPv1Q[1],time there are multiple stages in this where the cell actually divides if,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3799138,7.6624875,0.2882465,0.3121385
gL8h7lOPv1Q[2],divide and then it goes through division and the end result is two little cells like that and maybe,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3775552,9.627305,0.28736833,0.3291002
gL8h7lOPv1Q[3],like that and maybe this one i should've put that up here there because it's going to go through the process again and then this,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.39750588,7.1884813,0.30561048,0.33406025
gL8h7lOPv1Q[4],process again and then this daughter cell is going to go through its own little process whoa,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.38884062,9.372648,0.29667354,0.31813735
gL8h7lOPv1Q[5],if we were to throw the stages of the cell cycle on to a little circular image what you would see is that the cell is in a stage called most of the time,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.3919108,7.351343,0.29835308,0.32963532
gL8h7lOPv1Q[6],stages so let's look closer at the actual process of and break it down into its three little parts right here,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.41541475,8.261264,0.2995217,0.35273147
gL8h7lOPv1Q[7],characteristics for example during the cell's looks like this dude,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39944595,8.105493,0.2990958,0.34143162
gL8h7lOPv1Q[8],this dude i feel like i've got barkley the dog from sesame street hanging out here with me,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40485364,8.395611,0.3143319,0.34202027
gL8h7lOPv1Q[9],so most of the time that a cell is hanging out it's in and,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.38986206,7.2507586,0.31079406,0.25795966
gLTxaEcx41E[0],we're here talk now about hour texts j and k,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.42200208,7.5525446,0.31603706,0.13067558
gLTxaEcx41E[1],i can just bet that the citizens of athens as they thought about sophocles towards the end of the century would have thought about how the old man and his very very long career which is full of sufferings as well as successes could be identified with oedipus as a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.41098475,7.7266045,0.32529032,0.34499782
gLTxaEcx41E[2],and that's why at the end i'm asking myself well who is the here the man did not need and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.3969078,8.540757,0.28893116,0.3429318
gLTxaEcx41E[3],no if there was ever any mortal who was wondrous it was he,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.42621446,7.425566,0.31498265,0.19749452
gLTxaEcx41E[4],and greg i was wondering these are part of the text i each of them,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.40165496,10.747368,0.31526363,0.30767274
gLTxaEcx41E[5],and what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages well what i want to emphasize about text j which is part of the text i it is this privileged position of as not only the founding hero of athens as understood by the democracy in the century a version of the city of athens but also his role as the initiator of all athenians into what is called the mysteries,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.41173685,8.24798,0.30129674,0.299098
gLTxaEcx41E[6],the reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing or can i say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways is just pure mystery it's the,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.42051047,6.503484,0.32444918,0.27081344
gLTxaEcx41E[7],mystery it's the way an initiator initiates into mysteries,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.40345365,9.090417,0.29657844,0.34336746
gLTxaEcx41E[8],and that's why i want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of athens which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.40942806,6.539922,0.31011105,0.29923034
gLTxaEcx41E[9],what is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero and how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in that's what this is all about and that's what certainly sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.40997887,7.7549667,0.34566003,0.31485927
gLTxaEcx41E[10],and the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life but,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40539414,8.671523,0.31187046,0.23163672
gLTxaEcx41E[11],life but here in oedipus at colonus sophocles who's in his really identifies with this wretched old man and how he's struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.41019046,7.4287047,0.32431525,0.33120155
gR3igiwaeyc[0],but what marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints we entangled ourselves in new social constraints let's go to,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.39374787,9.44932,0.2653671,0.30505985
gR3igiwaeyc[1],constraints let's go to the thought bubble to explore this some more think about it like,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39668864,8.4564,0.29734188,1.0986652
gR3igiwaeyc[2],social one working together allowed us to transcend our natural constraints marx argued but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities thanks thought bubble,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.39895457,8.335725,0.27895498,0.31999946
gR3igiwaeyc[3],some more think about it like this,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40805233,8.928414,0.31460118,0.346843
gR3igiwaeyc[4],ten thousand years ago basically everybody spent all day trying to get food in this,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],0.40689307,9.227672,0.31271267,0.34670424
gR3igiwaeyc[5],get food in this primitive communism as marx called it people were strongly bound by natural constraints but socially very equal now compare,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.37929064,8.540736,0.28753275,0.30355734
gR3igiwaeyc[6],would come from but you also have the peasantry who still worked constantly making food in fact they spent,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39936608,5.70287,0.30846584,0.34117204
gR3igiwaeyc[7],making food in fact they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility people were producing,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.40101147,7.31276,0.3125828,0.33261716
gR3igiwaeyc[8],work harder that's not a natural constraint anymore that's a social one working together,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.39792013,4.9986196,0.30565196,0.32011688
gcFECfN4BCU[0],so what actually is personal branding you hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story so i,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.388888,7.3514094,0.28608358,0.29844993

gcFECfN4BCU[7],if you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area as a leader in some description then you probably already have a personal brand so a personal,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.40414244,8.502142,0.30658525,0.3233981

y3r2kk8zvl0[7],on one hand they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design the other hand they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution you really need to explore different solutions keep on,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.4086904,6.3735194,0.2965239,0.34542155
