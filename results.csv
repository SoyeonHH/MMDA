102213[2],there's definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really jokes and there's a lot of moments like that the story sucks,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.284628,0.17395301,2.561978,0.2654847
102213[3],moments like that the story sucks the characters were really wooden and plain and i liked some of the actors and actresses so i'm not sure what was going on there it,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.31915286,0.21640731,-4.6074305,0.2782952
102213[4],there it just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and uhh i guess the box office is reflecting that unfortunately,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.26836622,0.2208278,-2.33477,0.29753652

102213[8],million then i was thinking i don't know how a comedy can really be two hundred fifty million but you know i guess with all this hype it's worth seeing,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.29282278,0.24267222,0.32170227,0.3363392

102213[11],animals there seems to be a ton of but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and i'm not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know it all because the animals really weren't that impressive,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.29584807,0.2119235,-1.8934273,0.3470896

135623[1],i gotta say i've seen the other two spider man movies and i wasn't really that impressed you know they're pretty entertaining,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.2796076,0.21143587,-1.026697,0.3021857
135623[2],impressed you know they're pretty entertaining i guess and i'm a fan of uhh kirsten dunst so i always like to watch movies that she's in but i didn't have high expectations for spider man three because i didn't really like the first two but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations you,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.31896397,0.2047747,0.029089382,0.30957708
135623[3],expectations you know it was probably worse than i thought it would be actually,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.29091918,0.13625957,0.24195181,0.2388468
135623[4],granted i only paid two dollars to see it uhh there's a really cheap movie theater where i live that i can go see movies that have come out umm recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie you know just really cheesy uhh the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying like the stuff i don't,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.29037687,0.18216662,-2.1799648,0.37720895
135623[5],the stuff i don't know i'm not really into that and the action in it was really not that exciting umm the,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.29120484,0.18776485,0.26396024,0.33575964
135623[6],exciting umm the acting also horrible you know i realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in you know kind of over the top kind of cheesy but i don't know i feel,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.2977933,0.19257322,-1.7592949,0.37273303
135623[7],i don't know i feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the spider man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment i think that they could,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.28095964,0.20957577,0.032063097,0.36244282
135623[8],disappointment i think that they could have done a much better job on that movie,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.29064253,0.1875307,0.2565371,0.30226058
135623[9],umm so in a scale from like one to five i think i'd give it like a two honestly just not,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],0.2663119,0.18528958,-0.3129848,0.21157025

136196[1],uhh this is the third jurassic park obviously in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by steven spielberg he does executive,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.30533376,0.18588875,0.3260817,0.37426424
136196[2],forced i don't think it was needed at all and i didn't really enjoy it i actually found,[0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],0.30198887,0.19645382,0.16093238,0.3315775

136196[8],what i found most exciting about this movie when i first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars sam neill who was absent in the second movie,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],0.29345283,0.21941651,0.22900127,0.2927816

136196[10],uhh the second movie i didn't think was nearly as good as the first which is one of my all time favorite movies but uhh the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.28119847,0.20929009,-3.735384,0.27410415

273250[3],there's the investigation element but that's it you know,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30451423,0.1903366,1.5827101,0.34700096
273250[4],it you know what's the story what's the point,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.30737987,0.17794104,-0.23769878,0.270611
273250[5],there is none,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.30491427,0.19948678,3.6274638,0.33409208
273250[6],that's the flaw of this movie,[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29729402,0.23608792,7.7220197,0.28827545
273250[7],the script was written as sort of a sub element,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27176017,0.24250731,0.23167649,0.30682507
273250[8],you know it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.265641,0.17063057,0.14181103,0.41119847
273250[9],and that's why i can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five cause it was atrocious,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.2378522,0.27217105,-0.2611088,0.32121179
273250[10],and this isn't worth seeing at all cause i mean come on you can come up with better spy movies than this there are so,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.275662,0.21729173,0.23526879,0.35265788
273250[11],this there are so many,[1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.31121013,0.17806229,0.34569722,0.24677886
273250[12],and there it went,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.32719928,0.22085014,0.28777358,0.31494528
273250[13],and i mean not necessarily like spy like james bond but counter like you know investigation spy movies there are so,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28058964,0.16229361,0.086128965,0.32610112
273250[14],movies there are so many better ones to be doing,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.26428974,0.17724578,1.0626935,0.26806417
273250[15],so i have to say one out of five this was,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.28848696,0.1788469,-1.382734,0.3024878
273250[16],five this was horrible the premise,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.28899,0.20939805,0.3146373,0.28930816
273250[17],horrible the premise is barely there at all it's,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.269287,0.233774,0.30212063,0.38383302
273250[18],all it's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length which,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.27875602,0.2308488,0.20455374,0.24292721
273250[19],length which is bad because the actors do a good job but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk so,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.2510304,0.23781331,0.30284774,0.35613814
273250[20],junk so one out five for traitor thank,[0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.271301,0.22065425,-0.6312383,0.31750607
273250[21],so traitor is a movie about uhh it's a basic spy movie the premise,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2705598,0.18295126,3.4516854,0.2824846
273250[22],movie the premise here is really not good in any way shape or form but i will,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.27388093,0.23115014,0.2660899,0.31542474
273250[23],form but i will try to hack it together for you so,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30121297,0.21160123,0.291053,0.2419732
273250[24],you so this uhh sort of straight laced dude is investigating uhh a bunch of crazy stuff that happened and,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29410833,0.26568493,0.18254033,0.26408997
273250[25],happened and it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the us uhh is always seems to be connected to all of it so,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28310108,0.20398976,0.22197191,0.27419978
273250[26],of it so it's he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this and is he a good guy or a bad guy is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.31163624,0.21149027,-0.012750285,0.2434804
273250[27],that's the premise it's a,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28768942,0.2139029,3.56152,0.30675235

275267[7],but umm that's my opinion anyway like i,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29344118,0.15392478,-1.0678399,0.2289051
275267[8],bad it has tom in it uhh that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor it's got toby keith who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting and it's also got uhh ted nugent,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.25124705,0.22535957,-6.2018876,0.30142465
275267[9],he's a former umm rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either so i mean you're,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],0.27664736,0.17765139,0.13803059,0.32930684
275267[10],actor either so i mean you're you're stutter putting these people together to make this really bad movie and i guess that's what you're gonna get it's rated,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.271615,0.19782652,-0.19502342,0.3467905
275267[11],you're gonna get it's rated thirteen the premise,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2865998,0.18128385,2.5180333,0.21664299
275267[12],thirteen the premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something the sheriff,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.29643515,0.21797363,0.26625592,0.292609
275267[13],something the sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway so they take this,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30513108,0.23350815,0.33791265,0.25541243
275267[14],it anyway so they take this road trip and that's kind of how the movie goes and like i said you,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2896549,0.20185186,0.24343929,0.2787733
275267[15],movie goes and like i said you watch it for yourself and see what you think i mean i wouldn't,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.28400633,0.21368319,1.6709642,0.35625297

3wHE78v9zr4[5],the second issue this year is the technology education and accessibility in college and higher education act or the teach act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college the print,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.23956624,0.2114006,0.21805052,0.23723911

5lrDS7LluCA[6],happened in this i am gonna put on a longer version so you can go check that out if you want to but here's the supreme court battle,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.25971723,0.20854004,-3.9349582,0.29032922

5pxFqJ5hKMU[1],interest so that's a very quick way to reduce overall loan amount and build equity faster in your property again,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.32529503,0.22649916,0.37074772,0.30474287
5vwXp27bCLw[0],does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks,[0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.32851952,0.1975349,0.36658204,0.29947352
5vwXp27bCLw[1],if so is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system to try to get those banks to start lending i think it's,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.3044299,0.17559631,-0.9728172,0.34215823
5vwXp27bCLw[2],lending i think it's going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund,[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29028141,0.20686273,0.30217868,0.3178926
5vwXp27bCLw[3],another thing that addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.30192223,0.18162544,-0.76284707,0.29609662
5vwXp27bCLw[4],he specifically said again and again and again that his policies are going to be aimed to make sure that speculators don't benefit nor our people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.28139836,0.20328154,0.19378503,0.3540798
5vwXp27bCLw[5],place who is going to make that decision on who exactly was a speculator or who is going to make the decision on who bought a home that they could not afford does,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.27535453,0.19852403,-4.956833,0.32922918
5vwXp27bCLw[6],afford does this mean that we are going to potentially change our bankruptcy laws if,[0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.3118653,0.1984332,-0.4286279,-0.638429
5vwXp27bCLw[7],the bush administration had put forward a plan that was very very murky didn't have a correct alignment of incentives and so on it's also,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.31770125,0.20858477,1.0644367,0.41399696
5vwXp27bCLw[8],but it will be interesting to watch what exactly will the new bailout for the banks look like what exactly is this new lending fund mean how,[0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.31004018,0.20375243,-0.1683579,0.27593964

5vwXp27bCLw[10],one of the things that we see the press constantly talking about is this issue of potential nationalization of the banks our,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1.],0.3291783,0.14852558,0.25546163,0.36540172
5vwXp27bCLw[11],but if you look at president speech last night he made it clear that that's really not the path he intends on taking instead,[0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2609062,0.2251849,0.19936939,0.23330842
5vwXp27bCLw[12],the second issue that brings up and i think one that needs to be looked at very very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs it's,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.30964556,0.2789864,-0.39312667,0.20042922

P0UHzR4CmYg[2],for instance when you're doing e mail triage every morning do you question whether a particular e mail is from a real person or is it an e mail blast that's been personalized to you are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re targeted or do you stop looking at your direct messages on because all you seem to receive are automated messages your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are and in this discussion of automation let's also consider the human error factor,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.3161586,0.23636808,0.23954475,0.32911947

UweZVaFqruU[1],today i want to talk to you a little bit about credit a lot,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30305043,0.21219878,0.2277866,0.27650332
UweZVaFqruU[2],credit a lot of people ask what kind of credit do i need in order to buy a home well there's no set answer but there's a couple of things we look for we,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2711363,0.20384829,0.24245442,0.3023749
UweZVaFqruU[3],for we kind of look for as kind of a minimum score that we're trying to have in order to get an approval and obviously the higher the score the easier your approval will be the score,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29430753,0.17287533,2.9057689,0.27796736

UweZVaFqruU[6],another general tip is we're looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of months so if you don't have any credit you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage which is the biggest piece of credit you'll ever get,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.27971074,0.21039724,0.26649103,0.32109714

Wmhif6hmPTQ[0],deeper as people find that their situation gets a little bit more complex a financial plan grows to encompass things like retirement planning and making sure you're saving enough today to fund your retirement in the future,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.29901552,0.19914211,0.27050167,0.32758093

WoL4fCxGd8Q[0],hey everybody what's up i wanted to do a review of the new west paul mccartney and collaboration four five seconds it,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.31440943,0.14645737,0.8161518,-0.4076399
WoL4fCxGd8Q[1],seconds it got released about a day or so ago and the is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song now,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.30514988,0.17593499,-1.1523676,0.3321581
WoL4fCxGd8Q[2],down it is there's no drums in the song this song unlike only one doesn't sound like there are any keyboards there's no drums and no auto tune and it's basically paul mccartney playing acoustic guitar and and share vocal duties going back and forth and,[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.31525925,0.17202772,-4.0471835,0.3817254
WoL4fCxGd8Q[3],forth and vocals are definitely pretty on this song and has some pretty singing has,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.29557258,0.2057049,0.13553883,0.29853868
WoL4fCxGd8Q[4],singing has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that michael jackson did with paul mccartney,[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.28543305,0.17195202,-4.084297,0.3204351
WoL4fCxGd8Q[5],both artists are amazing talents but together they didn't really have amazing song writing capabilities when they were working in the same space and this song sort of feels like this too in fact,[0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.2981006,0.2141393,0.19809619,0.22186811
WoL4fCxGd8Q[6],too in fact this song sounds like something i would hear if i went to some coffee shop that only served free trade coffee and ran into three strangers that were just jamming together and came up with this song,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.26851007,0.15905182,-6.1316724,0.29686818
WoL4fCxGd8Q[7],if west and paul name and name wasn't attached to this song and the song just got released by three unknown people and sounded the same it wouldn't be getting the attention it's getting at,[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.25821218,0.22857565,-2.5100095,0.34651044
WoL4fCxGd8Q[8],song i give this song a i'd like to know what you guys think leave your comments in the section below thanks for,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3183798,0.18045215,2.4332473,0.33267668
WoL4fCxGd8Q[9],new song now this is the second collaboration that we know of that west has done with paul mccartney they released,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3144461,0.21576227,3.3438451,0.33730888
WoL4fCxGd8Q[10],information it's called if you have a question about anything you just it and you can find so much information at your finger tips but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song i've always found,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.32469213,0.22505938,0.28474697,0.3691955
WoL4fCxGd8Q[11],examples i wasn't a fan of only one i thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song i didn't have much expectation going in i am a fan,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.28080875,0.1657965,-2.1641796,0.40905836
WoL4fCxGd8Q[12],expectation going in i am a fan of paul mccartney and but i am not a big fan but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.30144063,0.19078887,-3.8048959,0.23719181
Wu-wQTmxRgo[0],watching me well i don't need that appeal like you guys allow you guys come here for the cinematic stuff for the which is what i love to spread the relationship stuff the the,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.26476222,0.18704174,4.9998927,0.27162573
Wu-wQTmxRgo[1],stuff the the corking is the around they always having fun whatever it,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27645352,0.1576752,0.31494212,0.23176904
WuaoxGAKue0[0],so because it doesn't make any sense i'm not going to remember any of it,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.252546,0.21141836,0.15632577,0.3441183
X2Hs89fZ2-c[0],in this module we're are focusing specifically on spatial data,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28339374,0.20864299,0.28471288,0.23498304
X2Hs89fZ2-c[1],we start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the software now,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27259475,0.20099688,0.26417682,0.26846457
X2Hs89fZ2-c[2],and pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29970604,0.23452233,1.5110263,0.27634606
X2Hs89fZ2-c[3],the last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to and in general,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27598,0.1900437,0.26713902,0.29407436
X2Hs89fZ2-c[4],software make sure you understand the difference between layers and features and and feature classes classes and feature classes and feature we also,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.31101778,0.16674006,-1.1597302,0.2432041
X2Hs89fZ2-c[5],allows us to display these not features for example population of the state population change what else can we display disease rates all of these,[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28400904,0.2003847,-3.4036047,0.21899669
X2Hs89fZ2-c[6],software now in module you were exposed to and so,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30621982,0.18355408,0.23907931,0.3002804
X2Hs89fZ2-c[7],disease rates all of these things can be stored within the data as an attribute table can be displayed this is,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30903843,0.25532278,0.3076949,0.2958811
X2Hs89fZ2-c[8],displayed this is what makes software so powerful it is also in this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are so,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30646867,0.2140637,0.2978275,0.2774976
X2Hs89fZ2-c[9],data are so making sure we know where to find what types of makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was so we,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.31007105,0.2584132,0.22179489,0.24695261
X2Hs89fZ2-c[10],five and in this class we really only use or feature classes so make,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30632192,0.22521116,-0.3097345,0.276924
X2Hs89fZ2-c[11],classes so make sure that you understand what separates and feature classes feature classes are stored in are not make sure you understand,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.32275575,0.20489109,0.2701776,0.28807735
X2Hs89fZ2-c[12],and so you should remember that is the main component of this is where,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30875134,0.19404078,2.1412108,0.26715022
X2Hs89fZ2-c[13],one file if you open up your open up your window explorer files versus opening it up in you will,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30556795,0.1787216,-5.6215873,0.30010816
X2Hs89fZ2-c[14],up in you will see you have several files associated with each data set so,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3125087,0.20425978,4.338933,0.29282293
X2Hs89fZ2-c[15],set so pay attention to the files that are associated with it and how to move data from place to place regardless of the data format we're looking at,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30290398,0.23006359,0.25217015,0.33688062
X2Hs89fZ2-c[16],of this is where you create your data edit data view data analyze your map create maps it is the workhorse of the program,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30307356,0.17259455,4.456267,0.2859209
X2Hs89fZ2-c[17],the second component is is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different change projection added everything like that,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28139186,0.19177815,2.3266628,0.26857913
X2Hs89fZ2-c[18],and then the last part the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course where we get,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28494486,0.19243155,0.32009006,0.20576529
X2Hs89fZ2-c[19],the course where we get into looking at very specific tools,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28498596,0.1972961,0.19218113,0.21675076
X2Hs89fZ2-c[20],data make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data make,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2987027,0.24567838,0.23682414,0.2588785

gL8h7lOPv1Q[9],so most of the time that a cell is hanging out it's in and,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27465582,0.17098431,0.27562374,0.2650361
gLTxaEcx41E[0],we're here talk now about hour texts j and k,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3081012,0.22949052,0.23442611,0.37540674
gLTxaEcx41E[1],i can just bet that the citizens of athens as they thought about sophocles towards the end of the century would have thought about how the old man and his very very long career which is full of sufferings as well as successes could be identified with oedipus as a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.29051232,0.17445873,0.3064448,0.28987116
gLTxaEcx41E[2],and that's why at the end i'm asking myself well who is the here the man did not need and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.2986385,0.16172922,4.76828,0.26093376
gLTxaEcx41E[3],no if there was ever any mortal who was wondrous it was he,[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.297436,0.20552604,2.1654153,0.18228032
gLTxaEcx41E[4],and greg i was wondering these are part of the text i each of them,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.30541563,0.74534523,-0.2506751,0.38987854
gLTxaEcx41E[5],and what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages well what i want to emphasize about text j which is part of the text i it is this privileged position of as not only the founding hero of athens as understood by the democracy in the century a version of the city of athens but also his role as the initiator of all athenians into what is called the mysteries,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.27261487,0.21476808,0.30477482,0.3234572
gLTxaEcx41E[6],the reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing or can i say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways is just pure mystery it's the,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.2562677,0.21512516,0.28170848,0.31413215
gLTxaEcx41E[7],mystery it's the way an initiator initiates into mysteries,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3083442,0.2009023,1.9897836,0.3141474
gLTxaEcx41E[8],and that's why i want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of athens which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.33848035,0.17918716,0.3308426,0.3453347
gLTxaEcx41E[9],what is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero and how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in that's what this is all about and that's what certainly sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.30095333,0.19987135,0.2552286,0.49635637
gLTxaEcx41E[10],and the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life but,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30249763,0.20793386,0.31002045,0.26982138
gLTxaEcx41E[11],life but here in oedipus at colonus sophocles who's in his really identifies with this wretched old man and how he's struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.29354167,0.19723722,0.24784884,0.3537641
gR3igiwaeyc[0],but what marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints we entangled ourselves in new social constraints let's go to,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29293603,0.206546,0.15565716,0.2735487
gR3igiwaeyc[1],constraints let's go to the thought bubble to explore this some more think about it like,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2849682,0.19071965,0.24619757,0.27864897
gR3igiwaeyc[2],social one working together allowed us to transcend our natural constraints marx argued but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities thanks thought bubble,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.24509199,0.20079978,0.12935992,0.29040065
gR3igiwaeyc[3],some more think about it like this,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28495628,0.20527236,4.5005183,0.32424787
gR3igiwaeyc[4],ten thousand years ago basically everybody spent all day trying to get food in this,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],0.32539272,0.21426024,0.43632904,0.33244842
gR3igiwaeyc[5],get food in this primitive communism as marx called it people were strongly bound by natural constraints but socially very equal now compare,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2828695,0.1910822,-0.008541467,0.25496495
gR3igiwaeyc[6],would come from but you also have the peasantry who still worked constantly making food in fact they spent,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3094583,0.22848675,-5.2626023,0.17980309
gR3igiwaeyc[7],making food in fact they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility people were producing,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],0.2796478,0.19325419,0.25925177,0.20484538
gR3igiwaeyc[8],work harder that's not a natural constraint anymore that's a social one working together,[0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.31537077,0.20768355,0.1423481,0.19508691
gcFECfN4BCU[0],so what actually is personal branding you hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story so i,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.31099296,0.17327614,0.23803614,0.29750776
gcFECfN4BCU[1],story so i am tori from that is what,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30631006,0.22687393,0.37975466,0.20760925
gcFECfN4BCU[2],your business so it doesn't matter what happens with those things because your business is always going to be long term and sustainable if it is about you and your personal brand everything,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.30080622,0.117092654,2.8294153,0.028160317
gcFECfN4BCU[3],brand everything else is like spokes that come off this central point which is you now,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3250752,0.21572158,0.58994615,0.30392113
gcFECfN4BCU[4],is you now it may or may not be a surprise to you that you actually already have a personal brand,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.2962314,0.20155089,0.30247736,0.3061034
gcFECfN4BCU[5],your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that so,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2868045,0.1794718,0.23129894,0.26451775
gcFECfN4BCU[6],people that so people can have a personal brand that actually don't have a business,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.2931941,0.1996021,0.18754864,0.3810256
gcFECfN4BCU[7],if you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area as a leader in some description then you probably already have a personal brand so a personal,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.3018311,0.17580654,0.22828063,0.29977635
gcFECfN4BCU[8],personal brand so a personal brand really is what you are known for by other people so what,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2955516,0.20008138,4.0472617,0.3182076
gcFECfN4BCU[9],people so what do other people say about you what do other people say that you do for a living those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand now personal brands,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2838853,0.22337134,2.8692942,0.3159181
gcFECfN4BCU[10],personal brand now personal brands can actually open a whole bunch of doors for you and if you make your personal brand official and make it a business then you can actually those opportunities which is what is super exciting about a personal brand and it is really something that you build overtime a personal brand,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.29435515,0.24521206,0.49754646,0.29315418
gcFECfN4BCU[11],overtime a personal brand isn't something that you can not have one day and have the next day you might make,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.2677361,0.19271296,4.8527308,0.28465915
gcFECfN4BCU[12],the next day you might make it more official but you actually don't create a personal brand that doesn't already exist within you so,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.2945366,0.25932735,0.2714772,0.37766522

gcFECfN4BCU[15],you would be great i love to hear what you guys think and pop over to my if you wanna learn,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27069247,0.13890667,-0.9276073,0.3064004
gcFECfN4BCU[16],my if you wanna learn more about the what the where and the how and everything to do with personal branding and setting up and your add in to the online all right,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.27294344,0.21924418,0.22825079,0.25536105
gcFECfN4BCU[17],from that is what i am going to talk about today so when,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30268762,0.16851085,0.26701444,0.20721455
gcFECfN4BCU[18],about today so when you brand yourself you are at the centre of your business,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.28639835,0.25120616,6.722182,0.31023076
gcFECfN4BCU[19],not your products not the things that you recommend but actually you so you probably,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.30344397,0.20786236,0.26572877,0.24496783
gcFECfN4BCU[20],actually you so you probably heard this before people actually relate to people and not businesses or companies so with,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.30898535,0.1748514,0.23973428,0.28864235
gcFECfN4BCU[21],companies so with a personal brand you can build a following of people that know like and trust you and when,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.26864117,0.19132505,3.3798754,0.29741582
gcFECfN4BCU[22],you and when people trust you they're now more likely to listen to your recommendations and want to know what it is that you are doing and how they can get the same thing or what it is what you are recommending because they trust that if they listen to you they are going to get the solutions that they are after and it's the solutions that are the most important with,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.29999384,0.22804387,0.28489023,0.2863936
gcFECfN4BCU[23],important with a personal brand it doesn't matter what happens with social media or any company that you are associated with or any products that you recommend because you are at the centre of your business so it doesn't matter,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.2964756,0.21718414,7.1742578,0.32264727
gpn71-aKWwQ[0],so when looking at financial aid opportunities the first thing i looked at were scholarships i applied,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.30440345,0.1407629,0.28482985,0.43434024
gpn71-aKWwQ[1],scholarships i applied to a lot and basically just did a quick search of scholarships that pertained to things that i was interested in applied,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.30421615,0.24193491,0.2778031,0.30985373
gpn71-aKWwQ[2],in applied to as many as i could that was you know humanly feasible and then i actually ended up getting a couple which was nice because,[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.],0.3334317,0.19472106,0.249301,0.33598834
grsV1YN1z5s[0],classes or perhaps you're directing a play and you want to do the best directing job that you can,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.285646,0.22254346,0.5043464,0.21542819
h1ZZHUU4j0k[0],hip hop if there's one thing that storytelling teaches us about life it's that different objectives require different tactics that achieve different results cause,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.32540905,0.19585155,0.27486768,0.27748817
h1ZZHUU4j0k[1],strategy we start creating daily content on for them sales,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.263302,0.2181846,5.826661,0.203149
h1ZZHUU4j0k[2],them sales start to go up and they can see that the conversion is coming from the audience on,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.],0.318355,0.22927988,0.28553247,0.2764699
h1ZZHUU4j0k[3],but then as we get towards the end of the schedule the end of the strategy someone remarks we don't like that the number of subscribers to our channel isn't as high as we'd like it to be or,[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],0.30292478,0.18726361,0.32246703,0.2774707

h1ZZHUU4j0k[5],be those notes provide an excellent opportunity to pivot towards new goals but they were never the target objective the target,[1. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.],[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.256881,0.21211526,5.242164,0.3114391

h1ZZHUU4j0k[12],going forward if you're aiming for year old men and the only people engaging with your content are year old women something's weird we've gotta pivot here,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.],0.3159436,0.15066391,0.27308038,0.30277663

y3r2kk8zvl0[7],on one hand they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design the other hand they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution you really need to explore different solutions keep on,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.],0.29153973,0.2120137,0.65194595,0.25072038
